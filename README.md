node-mongodb-json-server
========================

Testing setting up a json-server with Node, Restify and node-mysql.

Restify can very easily be replaced with Express, probably without any other changes in the code.

This json-server saves notes to a database.

I also did a similar test with mysql: https://github.com/frodefi/node-mysql-json-server

I will next do a test using socket.io, then I will also include authentication.
If you don't want to use socket.io, you can easily take out the authentication part and put it in here.

Please feel free to use this code as you like :)
